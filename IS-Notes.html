            <p>Information security is a term that describes protecting sensitive informations from unauthorized
                accesses, modifications, and disruptions.
                It covers many concepts from policies and laws to cryptography and cybersecurity processes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Information security contains many details in many sections.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Firstly, we have the theory concepts in information security like risk management, governance, and
                    policies.</li>
                <li>Also, we have the technical part of information security such as cryptography, and sniffing</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

         <!-- Section 2: Basics  -->
         <section class="main-section" id="Basics">
            <header>Basics</header>
            <p> The three basic terms in information security are the following: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Confidentiality</code></li>
                <li><code>Integrity</code></li>
                <li><code>Availability</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p> Each one be as a category for classifying threats. Confidentiality is for the unauthorized access that is a person got a low level privilege and access a high sensitive file.</p>
            <p>Integrity is protecting the files in the system of being modify by unauthorized access. And availability is the disruption of a file or make a system unavailable for the user to use.</p>
        </section>

    <!-- Section 3: Protection_Mechanisms  -->
    <section class="main-section" id="Protection_Mechanisms">
        <header>Protection Mechanisms</header>
        <p> We have four mechanisms helps us to protect a system or a file or even just a word. They are used to enforce layers of trust between security levels of a system.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Layering</li>
            <li>Abstraction</li>
            <li>Data hiding</li>
            <li>Encryption</li>
        </ol>

        <p><code>Layering</code> is guarding something using multilayer solution or a solutions layer to protect it. So if one layer have fall then the rest will still guard the system. The second one is <code>Abstraction</code> that is used for efficiency. Similar elements are put into groups, classes, or roles that are assigned security controls, restrictions, or permissions as a collective. Thus, the concept of <code>abstraction</code> is used when classifying objects or assigning roles to subjects.
        </p>
        <p><code>Data hiding</code>  is exactly what it sounds like: preventing data from being discovered or
            accessed by a subject by positioning the data in a logical storage compartment that is not
            accessible or seen by the subject. Forms of data hiding include keeping a database from
            being accessed by unauthorized visitors and restricting a subject at a lower classification
            level from accessing data at a higher classification level. Preventing an application from
            accessing hardware directly is also a form of data hiding. Data hiding is often a key element
            in security controls as well as in programming.</p>
        <p><code>Encryption</code> is the art and science of hiding the meaning or intent of a communication
            from unintended recipients. Encryption can take many forms and be applied to every type
            of electronic communication, including text, audio, and video files as well as applications
            themselves. Encryption is an important element in security controls, especially in regard
            to the transmission of data between systems </p>

    <!-- Section 4: Cryptography  -->
    <section class="main-section" id="Cryptography">
        <header>Cryptography</header>
        <p>Cryptography provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and nonrepudiation for sensitive information while it
            is stored (at rest), traveling across a network (in transit), and
            existing in memory (in use). Cryptography is an extremely important security technology
            that is embedded in many of the controls used to protect information from unauthorized
            visibility and use.
            Over the years, mathematicians and computer scientists have developed a series of
            increasingly complex cryptographic algorithms designed to increase the level of protection provided to data. While cryptographers spent time developing strong encryption
            algorithms, hackers and governments alike devoted significant resources to undermining
            them. This led to an “arms race” in cryptography and resulted in the development of the
            extremely sophisticated algorithms in use today.
            This chapter looks at the history of cryptography, the basics of cryptographic communications, and the fundamental principles of private key cryptosystems. The next chapter
            continues the discussion of cryptography by examining public key cryptosystems and the
            various techniques attackers use to defeat cryptography.</p>

        <p>Cryptography divides into two parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Symmetric</li>
            <li>Asymmetric</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some of the <code>symmetric</code> cryptography algorithms are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>DES</code></li>
            <li><code>AES</code></li>
            <li><code>Blowfish</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some of the <code>asymmetric</code> cryptography algorithms are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>RSA</code></li>
            <li><code>El-Gamal</code></li>
            <li><code>Elliptic curve</code></li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Section 5: Network Security  -->
    <section class="main-section" id="Network_Security">
        <header>Network Security</header>
        <p>Computers and networks emerge from the integration of
            communication devices, storage devices, processing devices,
            security devices, input devices, output devices, operating
            systems, software, services, data, and people. This chapter discusses the Open Systems
            Interconnection <code>OSI</code> model as a guiding principle in networking, cabling, wireless connectivity, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and related protocols,
            networking devices, and firewalls</p>
            
        <p>We have two models for network communication protocol:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>OSI model</li>
            <li>TCP/IP model</li>
        </ul>

        <p><code>OSI</code> model:</p>
        <p>Communications between computers over networks are made possible by protocols. A
            protocol is a set of rules and restrictions that define how data is transmitted over a network
            medium (e.g., twisted-pair cable, wireless transmission). In the early days of network development, many companies had their own proprietary protocols, which meant interaction
            between computers of different vendors was often difficult, if not impossible. In an effort
            to eliminate this problem, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model for protocols in the early
            1980s. Specifically, ISO 7498 defines the OSI Reference Model (more commonly called the
            OSI model). Understanding the OSI model and how it relates to network design, deployment, and security is essential in preparing for the CISSP exam.</p>
        
            <p><code>TCP/IP</code> model:</p>
            <p>The TCP/IP model (also called the DARPA or the DOD model) consists of only four layers, as opposed to the OSI Reference Model’s seven. The four layers of the TCP/IP model
                are Application (also known as Process), Transport (also known as Host-to-Host), Internet
                (sometimes Internetworking), and Link (although Network Interface and sometimes
                Network Access are used). Figure 11.5 shows how they compare to the seven layers of the
                OSI model. The TCP/IP protocol suite was developed before the OSI Reference Model was
                created. The designers of the OSI Reference Model took care to ensure that the TCP/IP protocol suite fit their model because of its established deployment in networking.</p>
